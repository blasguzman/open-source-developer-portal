# Overview: Send money to your users

In this guide, weâ€™ll cover the key points of transferring money:

- On-board a receiving customer for the funds transfer
- Associate a funding source (bank or credit union account) with the customer
- Transfer funds to a customer's linked bank account

## Before you begin

You need to have a [Sandbox account](/guides/sandbox-setup) already set up.

## Next step: Customer onboarding

The first step is to onboard a recipient for your transfer by creating a Customer and ensuring a funding source is added where money will be sent. Your application will need to capture the recipient's bank account information to pass through to Dwolla for secure storage.
